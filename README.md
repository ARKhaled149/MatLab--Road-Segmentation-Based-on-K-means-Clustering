# MatLab--Road-Segmentation-Based-on-K-means-Clustering
## Simple road segmentation based on K-means clustering using MatLab
### Steps:
### 1.  Read the image.
### 2.   Find a suitable pre-processing step to help with the road segmentation (Might need to see the segmentation mask output first).
### 3.   Use 4 clusters as initial centers for the K-means algorithm with the following centers:
#### C = [100 100 100 ;128 128 128 ;175 175 175 ;255 255 255];
### 4.   Process the output of the K-means to retrieve an image back.
### 5.   Find the cluster that represents the road. 
### 6.   Mask the road pixels and put it separately in a new image
### 7.   See the output and suggest a suitable post-processing step to improve the output.
### 8.   Save the final output as a .png.
